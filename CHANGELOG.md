## LinCity NG 2.11.0

date: 2024-06-24 <br/>
tag: lincity-ng-2.11.0 <br/>
git: afaede3d

###### Gameplay
- Nerfed ports by randomly disabling import/export.
- Reduced coal tax by 40%.

###### User Interface
- Renamed MWh and kWh commodities to "high-voltage power" and
  "low-voltage power" respectively with short names "hi-volt" and "lo-volt".
- Renamed "jobs" commodity to "labor".
- Fixed failure to load sound effects.
- Made in-game windows and dialogs resizable by dragging the edges/corners.
- Changed date format in status bar.

###### Internal
- Fixed portability for Windows.
- Added support for cross-compiling from Linux to Windows with MinGW-w64. (Now
  Windows binaries can be included in releases.)
- Fixed "Invalid ExtraFrames" warning caused by waste fires.
- Fixed some warnings re. excessive production/consumption.
- Added error checking for loading sound effects.
- Removed messages.pot generation from normal build. This removes the gettest
  build dependency except for translators. Translators must now generate the
  messages.pot file with a separate build step.
- Fixed missing git describe in package versions that are generated with CPack.
- Fixed extraneous link libraries.
- Added Include What You Use as a build step, and cleaned up includes.
- Improved handling of waste fires, so they are less bug prone.
- Refactored lintypes.cpp/hpp and moved some symbols to other files.
- Switched internal libraries from object to static type.
- Cleaned up target link libraries.
- Add fatal check for null in getGameView.
- Fixed handling of window size in fullscreen mode.
- Fixed some typos.

###### Documentation
- Added production/consumption formulas for each module to help pages.

###### Known Issues
- Some translations may be outdated since renaming commodities.
- Production/Consumption formulas do not exist in translated help pages.
- Requires SDL >= 2.26.0


## LinCity NG 2.10.2

date: 2024-04-19 <br/>
tag: lincity-ng-2.10.2 <br/>
git: a6101294

###### User Interface:
- Fixed a bug in installation/packaging which prevented creation of certain GUI
  components especially dialogs.


## LinCity NG 2.10.1

date: 2024-03-16 <br/>
tag: lincity-ng-2.10.1 <br/>
git: 3b8c58bf

###### Internal
- Fixed an unsafe memory write which could cause the game to crash.
- Added 'git' to the list of build dependencies.

###### Documentation / Translation
- Added a note in the readme to warn users of different build instructions for
  different versions of LinCity NG.


## LinCity NG 2.10.0

date: 2024-03-08 <br/>
tag: lincity-ng-2.10.0 <br/>
git: f03cbe18

###### Gameplay
- Fixed the amount of swing jobs created by health cover. You may now find that
  you need fewer residences and/or more jobs demand in your economy.
- Changed the effect of swing jobs. Now jobs production at residences scales
  down as inventory increases. This should make employment feel more stable and
  make it easier to strike a balance in employment. The amount of the production
  decrease is dependent on "swing" jobs, so sports cover and health cover
  increase the effect. The previous method using a "swingometer" has been
  abandoned.
- Fixed evacuation logic to avoid a construction getting negative inventory.
- Added water to the market trade dialog.

###### User Interface
- Fixed jumpy and laggy scrolling near the map edge.
- Fixed a bug where the shift key (used to increase scroll speed) was
  "forgotten" when hitting the map edge.
- Fixed a bug where moving the cursor outside the game window may cause the map
  to scroll.
- Fixed the speed and direction of scrolling with the scroll wheel in help
  pages.
- Changed the panning (i.e. scrolling by dragging) button from the right mouse
  button to the middle mouse button.
- Changed the panning (i.e. scrolling by dragging) direction, so the map moves
  in the expected direction.
- Added map scrolling with WASD.
- Changed the zoom anchor to be relative to the cursor position instead of the
  center of the screen. This makes map navigation much more natural. And it
  plays nice with hitting the map edge (which is more complex then you may first
  expect).
- Normalized scrolling speed for direction and zoom level. (So scrolling
  diagonally while zoomed in no longer feels like mach three.)
- Changed right-click action to show information about construction or tile.
- Added G-key action to toggles the right-click function between construction
  info or tile info.
- Decoupled the speeds of simulation, animation, screen redrawing, and GUI so
  animation and frame rate is no longer dependent on simulation speed. This
  makes the UI much smoother at slow simulation speed.
- Added a page to the MPS display for most constructions that shows monthly
  production/consumption of commodities (both as absolute and percentage).
- Tweaked the total inventory MPS page so that the red/green bars are faster to
  reflect changes in production.
- Constrained he minimap position to avoid showing space outside the map.
- Changed the cursor appearance for panning (i.e. scrolling by dragging).
- Created a (much prettier IMO) black background for the map.
- Fixed icon and desktop file install location for Linux systems.
- Added gd translation for desktop file.

###### Internal
- Fixed a buffer overflow when the home directory path name is very long.
- Fixed a bug in load/save where parks could erroneously get very high
  inventory.
- Fixed a bug where building the project could overwrite changes to GUI dialogs.
- Improved simulation performance. (Fast speed is now blazing fast.)
- Changed the location of save games from ~/.lincity-ng to
  ~/.local/share/lincity-ng. For now, existing save games from the old location
  are still loaded, but subsequent saves go to the new location.
- Replaced the outdated autoconf and Jam build tools with CMake. (Be sure to
  follow the updated instructions for building the project.)
- Changed install directory structure to match GNU style.
- Added binary generation to CPack.
- Added Dockerfile to help create compatible binaries for Ubuntu. (Now we can
  release binary packages.)
- Added a hook in the build system to append the current git hash to the version
  number when not on a release version. This should help reduce ambiguity in bug
  reports.
- Upgraded the MPS display API so constructions can have any number of pages.
- Removed uses of deprecated PhysFS features.
- Cleaned up the logic for binary relocation (and probably fixed a few things).
- Fixed errors and warnings when compiling with C++20.
- Fixed warnings when compiling with -Wall option.
- Added a construction initialization stage to loading and building
  constructions.
- Tidied up the source tree and deleted dead code.
- Added translation file generation build step.

###### Documentation
- Converted the readme to GitHub Markdown.
- Expanded the dependency list in the readme to include build dependencies.
- Included commands for installing dependencies on Ubuntu in the readme.
- Removed dead links in the readme.
- Updated the list of editors in translation instructions.
- Updated formatting in COPYING file.

###### Known Issues
- Untested on Windows and Mac.
- Infrastructure for building for Mac may be missing since updating the build
  tool.
- Ports are OP.
- Does not autodetect screen size on startup in fullscreen.
