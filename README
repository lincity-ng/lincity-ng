1. Introduction
LinCity-NG is a city simulation game. It is a polished and improved
version of the classic LinCity game. In the game, you are required
to build and maintain a city. You can win the game either by
building a sustainable economy or by evacuating all citizens with
spaceships.

2. Building and Installation


These are generic instructions, please see the wiki for more specific instructions

2.1 Prerequisites

The game depends on some tools and libraries to be present, before
you can start building it. Here's a list of them:

* normal gnu compiler and additional tools (g++ version 3.2 or later is
  required at the moment)

* perforce jam 2.5 or later (used as build tool)
  ftp://ftp.perforce.com/pub/jam

* SDL 1.2.5 or later
  http://www.libsdl.org

* SDL_mixer 1.2.4 or later (with ogg-support enabled)
  http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/

* SDL_image 1.2.3 or later (with png support)
  http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/

* SDL_ttf 2.0.8 or later
  http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/

* SDL_gfx 2.0.13 or later
  http://www.ferzkopp.net/~aschiffler/Software/SDL_gfx-2.0

* PhysicsFS 1.0.0 or later (use stable, NOT development branch 1.1.0)
  http://www.icculus.org/physfs/

* zlib 1.0 or later
  http://www.gzip.org/zlib/

* libxml 2.6.11 or later
  http://xmlsoft.org/

If you use packages from you distribution pay attention that you need
the header files in addition to the libraries. They are often in 
separate *-dev packages. Eg. for physfs you need libphysfs and libphysfs-dev.

2.2 Building

To build and install the game use the following commands:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure 
    jam

If you want to install the game, run as root:
    jam install

(If you compile the svn version you have to run ./autogen.sh first.)

The configure script also lets you set some more options like the installation
directory (--prefix argument). You'll get a full list of these if you invoke
"configure --help".

2.3 Starting the game

You can start the game by typing

    lincity-ng

2.4 Exit the game

If you are in the main menu, you can quit the program also by
pressing 'ESCAPE' or '^c'. This might be a way to terminate the
program even if the selected video-mode is not working as expected.
