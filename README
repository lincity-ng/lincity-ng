                     **  Welcome to lincity  **


This is the README for lincity 1.12, pre-release version.  


WHAT IS LINCITY
===============

Lincity is a city/country simulation game for Linux (SVGALIB and X), 
Solaris, FreeBSD, HPUX, AIX, SCO, IRIX, Compaq True64, BeOS, OS/2, VMS,
AtheOS, and Win32 (Win95, Win98, ME, NT, 2000, XP).

You are required to build and maintain a city. You must feed, house, 
provide jobs and goods for your residents. You can build a sustainable
economy with the help of renewable energy and recycling, or you can go for
broke and build rockets to escape from a pollution ridden and resource
starved planet, it's up to you. Due to the finite resources available in any
one place, this is not a game that you can leave for long periods of time.

Lincity recently moved to sourceforge.net.  This brings new CVS
access, mailing lists, and web pages.  If you are subscribed to 
lincity-users@floot.demon.co.uk, please also subscribe to the new
list, shown below, and make all of your posts there.  Please also note
the new home page, which is not yet complete.  Anyone with an eye for
design and a desire to help is welcome to make suggestions or design a
page to replace this one.

The lincity home page is now located at:

    http://lincity.sourceforge.net

The official users mailing list (mailman) can be subscribed to by visiting:

    http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/lincity-users

CVS commit notification can be had at:

REQUIREMENTS
============

   *  SVGALIB 1.3.0 (or greater).

      OR	 X11.

      OR	 A Win32 OS.

   *  A graphics card supported by your above choice.

   *  You probably need at least a 486DX2-66. (Even better for the X version 
      I suspect.)

   *  Other things?  Send us an email.


INSTALLATION (UNIX)
===================

To install lincity, (as root) untar the file lincity-1.12pre48.tar.gz 

     tar -xzvf lincity-1.12pre48.tar.gz

You now want to compile the source

      cd lincity-1.12pre48
      ./configure
      make

Lincity will run out of the source directory.  But if you want to install
you can do this:

      make install

The old method choosing the install directory by setting LC_BINDIR and 
LC_LIBDIR in the makefile no longer applies.  To install to a different 
directory, you must use the --prefix flag when you configure the package. 
For example:

      ./configure --prefix=/usr/mylocal

If you are installing a version downloaded from the cvs server, the 
timestamps may be incorrect, which will cause the "make" to fail.  In this 
case, you need to run a script to fix the timestamps:

      ./fix-timestamps.sh
      ./configure
      make
      make install


INSTALLATION (WIN32)
====================

Simply unpack the archive, and double click on the LINCITY.EXE icon.  
You can get your free copy of UNZIP from the INFO-ZIP web page at

    http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/UnZip.html.


UNINSTALLING (UNIX)
====================

If you still have the configured source directory, you can do this:

      make uninstall

Otherwise, do this (assuming you installed to /usr/local)

      rm /usr/local/bin/lincity
      rm /usr/local/bin/xlincity
      rm /usr/local/man/man6/lincity.6
      rm -rf /usr/local/share/lincity

In addition, if you ran lincity, you should delete these:

      rm -rf $HOME/.lincity
      rm $HOME/.lincityrc

If you have an older version, before 1.12pre54, you should delete this:

      rm -rf $HOME/.Lin-city


UNINSTALLING (WIN32)
====================

Like all good DOS programs, lincity runs within a single directory.
No files are copied to your "windows directory."  The windows registry
is not used.

Simply delete the lincity directory to uninstall.


RUNNING LINCITY (UNIX)
======================

Usually you will invoke the game with 'lincity' or 'xlincity'.  
Typing 'lincity' will run the SVGA version, while typing 'xlincity' will
run the X Windows version.  The SVGA version will not run under X.

             lincity  [opts]
             xlincity [opts]

The following options apply to both.

        -w   Do some *crude* gamma correction to boost the red and blue.
             This makes some 'washed out' displays a bit more colourful.
             You have control of the individual values, see below.

        -R <num>
        -G <num>
        -B <num>
             These options allow you to boost the individual colours.
             <num> is a number between 0.0 and 1.0
             The default values for -w are  1.0   0.0   0.4  (ATTOW)

This option only applies to lincity.

	-m <num>
	    Set the VGA mode.  See below for choices of mode.

This option only applies to xlincity.

	-r   Add an extra border around the game.
        -d   Double the size of the window to 1280x960

	-b   *obsolete* omit border around game.  Now on by default.


RUNNING LINCITY (WIN32)
======================

Double click the LINCITY.EXE icon.  The WIN32 version does not accept
command line arguments.


UPGRADING FROM VERSION 1.11
===========================

Lincity 1.12 is forward compatible with lincity 1.11, in the sense 
that 1.12 can read files generated in 1.11.  However, please note 
that you may need to copy over the save files.  Save files can 
be found in the following directories.  UNIX users note the change!

          Lincity 1.11                  Lincity 1.12
          ----------------              ----------------
UNIX      $HOME/.Lin-city               $HOME/.lincity
WINDOWS   %LINCITY_HOME%\SAVED_GAMES    %LINCITY_HOME%\SAVED_GAMES


THE LINCITY HOME DIRECTORY
==========================

If you get a message such as "Error. Can't find LINCITY_HOME", this
means that lincity can't find its home directory.  To find its 
home directory, lincity searches for the file "colour.pal" in 
the following three directories (in order):

	The directory pointed to by the $LINCITY_HOME environment variable
	The current working directory
	The default directory


LINCITY CONFIGURATION FILE
==========================

Lincity now has a configuration file for saving defaults.  You can 
find it in the following location:
          
UNIX:       $HOME/.lincityrc
WINDOWS:    %LINCITY_HOME%\lincity.ini

To reset to the "factory default" configuration, simply delete the 
file.  Lincity will regenerate the file if it is missing.


NOTES FOR SVGALIB VERSION
=========================

It is now possible to run at higher resolution.  You can use the command
line to set the mode:

      lincity                 ## default mode
      lincity -m 10           ## mode 10, 640x480
      lincity -m 11           ## mode 11, 800x600
      lincity -m 12           ## mode 12, 1024x768
      lincity -m 13           ## mode 13, 1280x1024

If not specified, lincity uses the default mode.  The default mode
can be set according to the SVGALIB_DEFAULT_MODE environment variable.
See "man svgalib" for details on the svgalib default graphics mode.
If no default graphics mode has been specified, lincity will use 
mode 10 (640x480, 256 colors).

As of version 1.12, lincity now uses the mouse settings in your 
svga configuration file (i.e. /etc/vga/vga.config).  Please use 
this method to specify which make/model of mouse you are using,
and other mouse parameters.


NOTES FOR X VERSION
===================

When playing in 256 colour (8bbp) display modes, when you go over the edge
of your window, the window manager changes the colour palette back to the
'normal' one, then back to the game's one when the mouse reenters the
window. This is what is supposed to happen, but can be a bit annoying when
trying to click on areas close to the edge and overshooting. For this
reason, I have added an extra border around the game to give players a bit
of 'breathing space'.

You can disable this feature by starting the game with a '-b' switch. ie.

                 xlincity -b

There is now a button that enables you to confine the mouse pointer within
the X window. ( xlincity -b, then confining the pointer and changing the
screen resolution to 640x480 gives you a 'full screen' game. :) )


NOTES FOR WIN32 VERSION
=======================

Lincity for Win32 automatically chooses whether or not to add a border 
and/or perform pix doubling, depending on your resolution.  Furthermore,
it will automatically maximize the window or even go into full screen
mode.  Here is what you should see for some of the more popular 
resolutions:
       
       Resolution      Window Style     Border         Pix Doubling
       ------------    ------------    ------------    ------------
       640 x 480       Full screen     None            No
       800 x 600       Window          Yes             No
       1024 x 768      Window          Yes             No
       1152 x 864      Window          Yes             No
       1280 x 1024     Window          None            Yes

If you are running 1280x1024, you may need to autohide the taskbar
in order to see pix doubling.

Lincity no longer uses a real windows font to draw text.  Although this 
gives a considerable speed improvement (about 20%), it sometimes 
doesn't work correctly, for a reason that I haven't yet identified.

Save files are gzip compatible with the UNIX version of lincity.  That is,
you will need to gzip/gunzip the save files when you transfer them to/from
your UNIX box.

The source code is distributed together with the binary distribution,
in the file source.tgz.


INTERNATIONALIZATION UNDER LINUX
================================

Lincity supports a modest amount of internationalization.  Only languages
that can be represented using a iso8859-1 font are currently supported.
I have created a lincity-compatible iso8859-2 font also, but have not used 
it yet because of no demand (send me an email if you would like to try).

If you wish to make a translation for your language, you will need to 
download and install gettext 0.11.2 or higher.

The first task is to get the sample Italian translation to display 
correctly.  Download a fresh lincity (1.12pre53 or higher) from
sourceforge.  Do a configure, make, and make install.

Next, download the Italian package.  Install as described in README.it.
Run as follows:

   export LANG=it_IT          ## (on bash and similar)
   setenv LANG it_IT          ## (on csh and similar)
   xlincity -D

Hopefully you will see something like this:

   Setting entire locale to it_IT
   Setting messages locale to it_IT
   Query locale is it_IT
   GUESS 1 -- intl_suffix is it_IT
   Trying Message Path /home/gsharp/lincity/share/lincity/messages/it_IT/
   Trying Help Path /home/gsharp/lincity/share/lincity/help/it_IT/
   GUESS 2 -- intl_suffix is it
   Trying Message Path /home/gsharp/lincity/share/lincity/messages/it/
   Set Message Path /home/gsharp/lincity/share/lincity/messages/it/
   Trying Help Path /home/gsharp/lincity/share/lincity/help/it/
   Set Help Path /home/gsharp/lincity/share/lincity/help/it/
   Bound textdomain directory is /home/gsharp/lincity/share/locale
   Textdomain is lincity
   DefaultVisual id=35 bp-rgb=8 map-entries=256


If you see this, then everything worked perfectly.  You should see perfect
italian.  In particular, note the following:

  (1)  The opening screen (help page) is in Italian
  (2)  The month january will be written "Gen" instead of "Jan"
  (3)  Click on something that hasn't been invented yet, like a 
       power station or windmill.  The message for "Not enough tech" 
       will be in Italian.

It is possible that you see English for (1) and (3).  If so, you 
are probably running from the directory you built from.  Please cd 
out of that directory, and try again.

If you are less lucky, maybe only (1) and (3) worked correctly and 
but not (2).  If so, you probably saw something like this:

   Setting entire locale to (null)
   Setting messages locale to (null)
   Query locale is C
   GUESS 1 -- intl_suffix is it_IT
   Trying Message Path /usr/local/lincity/messages/it_IT/
   Trying Help Path /usr/local/lincity/help/it_IT/
   GUESS 2 -- intl_suffix is it
   Trying Message Path /usr/local/lincity/messages/it/
   Set Message Path /usr/local/lincity/messages/it/
   Trying Help Path /usr/local/lincity/help/it/
   Settling for help Path /usr/local/lincity/help/
   Bound textdomain directory is /lincity/share/locale
   Textdomain is lincity
   DefaultVisual id=35 bp-rgb=8 map-entries=256

If this happens, it means that your system is missing some files which 
are require to "set the locale" of your system to "it_IT".  Probably 
you are running Linux -- I don't think other Unix's have this peculiar 
requirement.

To check if this is the problem (on Linux), look for the directory 
/usr/lib/locale/it_IT.  If this directory doesn't exist, you have this
problem.  To fix it, do the following:

   1)  Make a backup of the directory /usr/share/i18n/charmaps
   2)  Make a backup of the directory /usr/share/i18n/locale
   3)  cd /usr/share/i18n/charmaps
   4)  gunzip UTF-8.gz
   5)  gunzip ISO-8859-1.gz
   6)  cd /usr/share/i18n/locale
   7)  localedef -f ../charmaps/UTF-8 -i it_IT it_IT.UTF-8
   8)  localedef -f ../charmaps/ISO-8859-1 -i it_IT it_IT

Now check for the directory /usr/lib/locale/it_IT.  It will be there.

OK, now you are ready to make translations for a new language.  
There are three parts to making a tranlation:
   making help files
   making message files
   making a .po file.

The messages and help files are just a matter of editing the ASCII 
files, and installing them.  If your language is "it", you should 
create two directories such as /usr/local/share/lincity/messages/it
and /usr/local/share/lincity/help/it.  Copy the english language 
help and message files to these directories, and translate them.

The .po file is a matter of translating these and getting them to compile 
correctly.  First, edit the file po/LINGUAS, and add your language 
(e.g. "it") to the list.  Next, create the .po file.  For the language
"it", the command looks like this like this:

   cd po
   msginit -l it

You should now see the file "it.po".  Edit this file.  Specifically,
you should edit what comes after "msgstr".  Don't erase any of the 
other stuff such as "msgid" or "#: cliglobs.c:54" or that stuff.
If you are using emacs, there is a "po-mode" to facilitate 
(or obstruct) this task.

When you are done editing this file, you need to compile this file.
Simply type "make" in the po directory to compile.  This will 
create the file "it.gmo".  Finally, you will need to install this file.
To install, you will copy this file to the following location:

  cp it.gmo /usr/local/share/locale/it/LC_MESSAGES/lincity.mo

Now, you are ready to go.  Set the LANG environment variable and 
lincity should run using your translations.

Email to gregsharp@geocities.com for comments about this process.


INTERNATIONALIZATION UNDER WINDOWS
==================================

The situation under windows is similar.  Download lincity 
version 1.12pre53 binary package, and the Italian translation pack.
Install the Italian translation pack directly into the lincity 
directory.  Then run the batch file:

  c:\lincity> lincity-it

Now, you should see:

  (1)  The opening screen (help page) is in Italian
  (2)  The month january will be written "Gen" instead of "Jan"
  (3)  Click on something that hasn't been invented yet, like a 
       power station or windmill.  The message for "Not enough tech" 
       will be in Italian.

If the above procedure doesn't work "out of the box", email 
to gregsharp@geocities.com.

OK, now you are ready to make translations for a new language.  
There are three parts to making a tranlation:
   making help files
   making message files
   making a .po file.

The messages and help files are just a matter of editing the ASCII 
files, and installing them.  If your language is "it", you should 
create two directories such as /usr/local/share/lincity/messages/it
and /usr/local/share/lincity/help/it.  Copy the english language 
help and message files to these directories, and translate them.

The .po file is a matter of translating these and getting them to compile 
correctly.  First, make copy the file lincity.pot to your language 
(e.g. "it.po" for Italian).  If you do not have a lincity.pot file, 
email gregsharp@geocities.com to get the latest one (or get it 
directly from the CVS server on sourceforge).

You should now see the file "it.po".  Edit this file.  Specifically,
you should edit what comes after "msgstr".  Don't erase any of the 
other stuff such as "msgid" or "#: cliglobs.c:54" or that stuff.
If you are using emacs, there is a "po-mode" to facilitate 
(or obstruct) this task.

When you are done editing this file, you need to compile this file.
Use the executable "msgfmt.exe" which is distributed with lincity 
for this purpose:

  c:\lincity> msgfmt it.po -o it.gmo

This should create the file it.gmo.  You need to copy it to a 
prespecified location, like this:

  c:\lincity> copy it.gmo locale\it\LC_MESSAGES\lincity.mo

Create the appropriate subdirectories as necessary.

Now, you are ready to go.  Set the LANG environment variable 
and lincity should run using your translations.


INSTALLING PICEDIT
==================

Picedit is deprecated.  It may or may not compile.

picedit is a simple drawing program that was used to draw all the icons
found within the game. You are free to play with this, and even send me
new icons that you have designed - although I cannot guarantee that any
icons sent to me will be included in later versions. If you intend to design
some that you feel should be included, please e-mail me first, this may save
a lot of wasted effort.  The following commands

    ./configure
    make picedit   (or make xpicedit)
    make install

will compile and install picedit (or xpicedit).  Most likely, you will 
prefer to install picedit and lincity at the same time to avoid copying 
all of the help and message files multiple times, like this:

    ./configure
    make lincity
    make picedit
    make install

By the way, xpicedit does not work on hi-color or full-color displays.


COMPILATION UNDER WIN32
=======================

I use both MS VC++ 4.0 and MS VC++ 6.0 on Win95 and Win98.  I no longer
include the MSVC workspace files or makefiles, since these do not 
seem to be particularly useful.  If you would like them, I'd be glad 
to send them to you.

You may need to generate your own Makefile.  The file Makefile.am 
contains the information about which files you need to compile.  
As of version 1.12, you no longer need to link with your vendor 
supplied versions VERSION.LIB or WSOCK32.LIB.

Lincity 1.11 was patched to compile with the Borland compiler 
too.  If this is not still working in 1.12, please send me a patch 
and I'll be happy to add it to the archive.


RUNNING LINCITY (CLIENT/SERVER)
===============================

Client/server version is disabled for this version.  In fact, the code 
was completely removed as of version 1.12pre50, so the last version to 
contain the (non-functioning) network code was 1.12pre49.

If you are interested in working on a client/server version, please send 
your email to the current maintainter or to the lincity mailing list.
We are still interested in doing this!


BUGS
====

Many.  See the file TODO.

If you wish to report a bug, you can send to directly to the current
maintainer or to the lincity mailing list.


HISTORY
=======

Ian Peters started writing lincity in June 1995 as an exercise in 
mouse control in SVGALIB. It quickly became a usable, then even fun, 
game to play. Over the next 18+ months it evolved into a challenging 
and stable game which, in a number of people's opinion, is worth uploading 
to the net.

In late 1997, lincity developers made grand plans for lincity version 2, 
an intergalactic space simulation with all the trimmings.  But from 
1998-1999, lincity underwent a period of hibernation, with only minor 
patches being applied.  

Development was restarted in late 1999 by Greg Sharp to provide
some moderate improvents, including networking support, GUI
improvements and additional gameplay developments.  

In mid-2001, Greg was joined by Corey Keasling, who helped to bring
the game to sourceforge.net.  In late 2001, Corey became
co-maintainer.  Having him partially in charge is a devastating blow
to the game, ensuring no stable release until lincity 1.12pre2451.
