 * @class Color
 * @brief This class defines a color in RGBA color space.
 *
 * You can specify a red, green, blue and alpha value from 0 to 255. For
 * red/green/blue a value of 0 means no saturation a value of 255 is full
 * saturation.
 *
 * The alpha value does not change the color, but specifies the opacity of drawn
 * pixels. A value of 255 means full opacity a value of 0 means nothing is
 * drawn (= full transparent).
