FAQ for LinCity.


GENERAL
*******

Q. I did a make install, but I've got no binaries.

A. If you got the source only distribution you need to compile the programs.
Use 'make' on its own, to get a list of options.


Q. I compiled and installed, but I get a 'no such file' error when I try to
run lincity.

A. Make sure the directory where the Makefile installed the binaries is on
your path (the library directory does not have to be on your path). To see
where it will be installed, type 'make' on its own. This will show you what
the current install paths are.


SVGALIB VERSION
***************

Q. The mouse doesn't seem to work even if I try every available type.

A. SVGALib seems to want write permissions on /dev/ttySx  (aka /dev/mouse).
My permissions are

crw-rw-rw-   1 root     tty        4,  64 Feb 21 18:27 /dev/ttyS0

The command   'chmod 666 /dev/ttyS0'   will give you the correct
permissions. ( or ttyS1 if your mouse is on 'COM2' )


Q. All the text seems to be 'Greek'.

A. You need at least version 1.2.9 of SVGALIB.


Q. I compiled and installed, but I get a permission denied when I try to run
lincity as anyone but root.

A. The install failed to make the file lincity suid root. 
  'make install'   again making sure that you are root.


X VERSION
*********

Q. When I move the mouse in and out of the xlincity window, the colour
palette flashes between the 'normal' colours and lincity's own. It's REALLY
annoying!

A. If you can, run your X server in a mode that displays more than 256
colours. Sorry, this is not always possible and depends on your hardware. I
use a 2M pci card and 'startx -- -bpp 16' to get 64K colours. It's really
nice.

Alternatively, there is a 'confine pointer' button, under the select
buttons, that traps the mouse pointer in the lincity window. Press it again
to release it.
