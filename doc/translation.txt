0. How to Translate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Install gettext
* get a snv snapshot of lincity-ng and do the usual autogen.sh, configure.
  Make sure configure can find the xgettext application.
    (ie. "checking for xgettext... xgettext")
* Run 'jam', let it compile. It should create data/locale/messages.pot and
  data/locale/gui/messages.pot files
* Go into data/locale and data/locale/gui and in each dir do:
     - In case you want to create a new translation do
        msginit -i messages.pot -o $LANG.po
       (where $LANG is the 2character handle of your language)
     - In case you want to update an existing translation do
        msgmerge -U $LANG.po messages.pot

* Edit the .po files with your favourite Editor or with 1 of the GUI tools
  below.
* Send the translated .po files to the lincity-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
  mailing list.
* You should also edit the lincity-ng.desktop file and add a comment entry for
  your language

2. GUI Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 KBabel      - a long dated KDE program that has been maturing over the years,
               and it's really handy by now.
 poEdit      - a multi-platform po editor (runs under Windows and Unix).
               URL: http://poedit.sourceforge.net/
 (X)Emacs    - a commonly used program for translating with the respective
               plugin.
 QTranslator - made by Qt, has the advantage of running in several platforms.
               PO files are written in ASCII and are pretty intuitive, so they
               can be used by any text editor. But it would be wise to use a
               program made for that effect. If not possible, use a text editor
               with highlighting for PO files.
