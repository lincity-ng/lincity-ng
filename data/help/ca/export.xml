	<p style="htitle">Import and export areas</p>
	<p style="hp">Importing and exporting work in the same way except that the first costs you money and the second makes you money. Both requires a Port. For this reason, only exporting will be dealt with in detail.</p>
	<p style="hp">To export, the port must be connected with a road.</p>
	<p style="hp">They <b>must</b> be connected to rivers all along the right hand side.</p>
	<p style="hp">The export area will take as much as it is given. If you need to export, but want to  restrict the amount, you may want to use a type of transport with less capacity, use a long piece or pass the product through a market. You will need to experiment to get the right transport configuration.</p>
