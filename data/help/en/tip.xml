	<p style="htitle">Tips (rubbish dumps)</p>
	<p style="hp">Tips provide a place to put your rubbish. If you accumulate too much at markets, they are forced to burn some. This makes quite a lot of pollution so you should be wary of letting rubbish accumulate.</p>
	<p style="hp">As the tip is filled, it slowly turns into a hill, which is grassed over when it is full.</p>
	<p style="hp">If you clean up your city the trash from the tip can be re-excavated and processed in forests, electrified farms and recycling centers.</p>
	<p style="hp">You can see when a tip is working in the usual way, by clicking on it</p>

	<p style="hp">1: 200 waste =&gt; 200 buried waste</p>
	<p style="hp">2: 200 buried waste =&gt; 200 waste</p>
	<p style="hp">Tips target 20% waste inventory. If there is more than 20% waste inventory, then formula 1 is applied. If there is less than 20% waste inventory, then formula 2 is applied.</p>
	<p style="hp">Buried waste degrades daily at a rate of 0.5% per year.</p>
