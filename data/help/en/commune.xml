	<p style="hp">Forests (aka Communes) are areas where charcoal burners coppice woods to make charcoal (the same as coal here). They also produce small amounts of ore and steel.</p>
	<p style="hp">You will probably need a 'few' communes to provide enough coal and steel for areas such as potteries, blacksmiths and mills.</p>
	<p style="hp">If a commune is not producing anything for 10 years it is closed and the area turns into parks.</p>
	<p style="hp">Communes' coal production depends on underground water unless they receive fresh water via transport. (tiles with water are green, others are yellow-brown like desert)</p>

	<p style="hsubtitle">Formulas</p>
	<p style="hp">0 =&gt; 3 coal + 6 ore + 2 (per 20 days) steel</p>
	<p style="hp">If there is not enough capacity to produce a certain commodity, then the others may still be produced.</p>
	<p style="hp">If a commune has less than 100% fertility, then it will produce proportionally less coal. A lack of fertility can be compensated for by consuming 5 water per desert tile.</p>
	<p style="hp">If a commune has at least 15% waste inventory, then it will consume 20 waste and it may produce 1 ore.</p>
