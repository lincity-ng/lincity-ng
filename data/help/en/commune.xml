    <p style="hp">Forests (aka Communes) are areas where charcoal burners
    coppice woods to make charcoal (the same as coal here).
    They also produce small amounts of ore and steel.</p>
    <p style="hp">You will probably need a 'few' communes to
    provide enough coal and steel for areas such as potteries, blacksmiths and mills.</p>
    <p style="hp">If a commune is not producing anything for 10 years
    it is closed and the area turns in parks.</p>
    <p style="hp">Communes can connect to transport at any point around it, not only to the gate.</p>
    <p style="hp">Communes' coal production depends on underground water unless they receive fresh water
    via transport. (tiles with water are green, others are yellow-brown like desert)</p>
