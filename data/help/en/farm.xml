	<p style="hp">Farms grow food for people to eat, and to supply the raw materials for mills.</p>
	<p style="hp">Production of farm depends on underground water. Tiles with water are green, others are yellow-brown (like desert or bare ground).</p>

	<p style="hp">Farms need labor to produce more than a minimal amount of food. Providing elecricity (lo-volt) boosts the output. Powered farms can irregate dry soil and also consume wastes. Beware of agricultural water consumption.</p>

	<p style="hsubtitle">Formulas</p>
	<p style="hp">13 labor + 50 lo-volt =&gt; 550 food + 5.5 food * tech</p>
	<p style="hp">13 labor =&gt; 132 food</p>
	<p style="hp">If a farm has less than 100% fertility, then it will produce proportionally less food. A powered farm can compensate for lack of fertility by consuming 50 water per desert tile.</p>
	<p style="hp">Unlike most other constructions, a farm scales the formulas proportionally when they cannot be fully applied.</p>
