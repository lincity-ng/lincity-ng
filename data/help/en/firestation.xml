	<p style="htitle">Fire stations</p>
	<p style="hp">Fire stations prevent the start and spread of fire within the range that they cover. They need to be supplied with goods and labor to work. They also cost money to run.</p>
	<p style="hp">When you build a fire station, it does not start straight away. There is usually a three month wait before fire cover is provided.</p>
	<p style="hp">To see the area that your fire stations cover, click on the fire station button under the mini screen.</p>
	<p style="hp">Fire stations increase the desirability of residential areas within their range.</p>
	<p style="hp">Fire stations go through an animation sequence every three month to show that they are working.</p>
