    <p style="htitle">Fire stations</p>
    <p style="hp">Fire stations prevent the start and spread of fire within
    the range that they cover. They need to be supplied with goods and jobs
    to work. They do not have to be connected to transport, they do though have
    to be within range of a market that can supply the jobs and goods. They also cost money to run.</p>
    <p style="hp">When you build a fire station, it does not start straight away.
    There is usually a three month wait before fire cover is provided.</p>
    <p style="hp">To see the area that your fire stations cover, click on the
    fire station button under the mini screen. Areas that have fire cover are
    displayed as normal, areas not covered are just dark green.</p>
    <p style="hp">Fire stations increase the desirability of residential
    areas within their range.</p>
    <p style="hp">Fire stations go through an animation sequence
    every three month to show that they are working.</p>
