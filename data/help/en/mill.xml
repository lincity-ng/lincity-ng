	<p style="hp">Mills convert food, coal and jobs into goods. Food?... well, cotton and wool are counted as food in this game.</p>
	<p style="hp">Mills use quite a lot of food, so you can easily get into food shortages if you don't take this into account. (It is less of a problem when you have windmills, as they can power farms which makes them more efficient)</p>
	<p style="hp">Mills do not have to be connected to transport. If not, they do have to be in range of a market with coal, jobs and food. You can tell when mills are working by the smoke and steam coming from the building.</p>
