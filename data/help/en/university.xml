    <p style="hp">Universities help to increase your technology level.
    In the process they consume goods and jobs. They produce more than schools for a given goods/jobs input.
     However they cunsume a lot of goods and jobs and also cost quite a lot of money to run, so you should
     have the economic and industrial capacity to supply them.</p>
    <p style="hp">You will need a number of universities to achieve a tech level close to 100%</p>
    <p style="hp">Universities do not need to be connected to transport; they can get all their
    requirements from markets within range and with enough jobs and goods available.</p>

    <p style="hsubtitle">NOTE</p>
    <p style="hp">You must have 4 schools per university to supply them with students.</p>
