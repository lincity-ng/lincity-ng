    <p style="hp">Schools use jobs and goods to produce technology in a similar way to universities.
    They use far fewer jobs and goods than universities, but produce far fewer tech points.
    Given the choice between putting four or five schools in a given area, or a single university,
    it is often (but not always) better to put a university in.</p>
    <p style="hp">Schools do not need to connect to transport, but do need to be within
    range of a market than can supply the quantity of jobs and goods to make the school work.</p>
    <p style="hp">Schools cost money to run. You can see the total cost for the last year by clicking on the money button.</p>
    <p style="hp">You can see when a school is working in the usual way, by clicking on it.</p>
