	<p style="hp">Schools use labor and goods to produce technology in a similar way to universities. They use far fewer labor and goods than universities, but produce far fewer tech points. Given the choice between putting four or five schools in a given area, or a single university, it is often (but not always) better to put a university in.</p>
	<p style="hp">Schools do not need to connect to transport, but do need to be within range of a market than can supply the quantity of labor and goods to make the school work.</p>
	<p style="hp">Schools cost money to run. You can see the total cost for the last year by clicking on the money button.</p>
