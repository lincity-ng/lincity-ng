	<p style="hp">Monuments provide a focal point for the teaching and inspiration of inventers. Every monument you build will increase the rate of technology growth, but their effectiveness drops to zero as you get toward 40% tech level.</p>
	<p style="hp">To build a monument, you need to provide jobs, a <b>lot</b> of jobs. For this reason they are useful for controlling unemployment. This is only a short term solution to an unemployment problem as monuments don't use any jobs after they are fully built.</p>
	<p style="hp">You can tell how far building has progressed by clicking on the monument and looking at the stats window (top left of centre). Also the graphic changes as it is built. There are 6 graphics that show the stages of construction from 0% to 100%</p>
	<p style="hp"><b>Hint</b>: How to stop monument building sucking too many jobs out of an area and therefore starving other areas of jobs: Build a monument farm away from other areas.</p>
