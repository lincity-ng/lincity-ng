	<p style="hp">There are 2 ways to "win" the game:</p>
	<li>Reach <a href="sustain">sustainable economy</a> (you can still play after)</li>
	<li>Evacuate all the population with <a href="rocket">spaceships</a> to another planet, then the game stops.</li>
	<p style="hp">Currently there is only one way to lose:</p>
	<li>Everybody is dead because of starvation or pollution. (you know that you need at least 2 people to create a populationÂ ;-)</li>
	<p style="hp">You will need to increase your tech-level to get new possible buildings and industries. You have to manage the growth of population, and take care of various needs and economical balance.</p>
