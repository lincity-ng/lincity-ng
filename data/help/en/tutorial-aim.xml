<p style="htitle">Aim of the game </p>
<p style="hp">There are 2 ways to "win" the game:</p>
<li>Reach <a href="sustain">sustainable economy </a> (you can still play after) </li>
<li>Evacuate all the population with <a href="rocket">spaceships </a> to another planet, then the game stops. </li>
<p style="hp"></p>

<p style="hp">Currently there is only one way to lose:</p>
<li>Everybody is dead because of starvation or pollution. (you know that you need at least 2 people to create a population ;-) </li>
<p style="hp"></p>

<p style="hp">You will need to increase your tech-level to get new possible buildings and industries. You have to manage the growth of population, and take care of various needs and economical balance. </p>
