	<p style="htitle">Tech Level</p>
	<p style="hp">Your city's technology level determines a number of things, such as what you can build and the efficiency of certain processes.</p>
	<p style="hp">To increase your technology, you must build (and supply with the appropriate inputs) Monuments, Schools and  Universities.</p>
	<p style="hp">When your tech level is very low you can only build monuments. When a few of these have been around for a while, you will then invent schools. Schools produce more technology than monuments.</p>
	<p style="hp">When your tech level reaches a higher value still, you will invent universities. These produce even more technology than schools, but are very resource hungry.</p>
	<p style="hp">The more technology you have, the faster it erodes. This means that the higher you want your tech level to be, the more schools and universities you will need.</p>
	<p style="hp">Also, be aware that if for some reason you need to take out, say, a university or two (or they are suddenly starved of resources) your tech level is likely to start falling.</p>
	<p style="hp">Percentage of chance for a successful rocket launch is equal to your tech-level.</p>
