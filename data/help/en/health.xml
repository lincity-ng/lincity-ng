	<p style="hp">Health centres provide health cover for residences.</p>
	<p style="hp">Health cover makes the residence a more desirable place to
        live, less people die from pollution related illness and the people 
        living there are more efficient at providing jobs to the surrounding 
        areas (they spend less time off sick).</p>
	<p style="hp">Running health centres is expensive. However, they reduce
        the cost of 'unnatural deaths' and can provide extra income tax
        (as long as there are places for the people to work).</p>
	<p style="hp">After you put a health centre in, it takes three months for
        it to become active. They use goods.</p>
	<p style="hp">Health centres need to be connected to transport or within
        range of a market.</p>
	<p style="hp">To see the range of health cover, click on the health icon
        above the 'mini screen' (bottom right of centre on the display). 
        The areas that show up as normal have health cover.</p>
