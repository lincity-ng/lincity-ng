	<p style="hp">Health centres provide health cover for residences.</p>
	<p style="hp">Health cover makes the residence a more desirable place to live, less people die from pollution related illness and the people living there are more efficient at providing labor to the surrounding areas (they spend less time off sick).</p>
	<p style="hp">Running health centres is expensive. However, they reduce the cost of 'unnatural deaths' and can provide extra income tax (as long as there are places for the people to work).</p>
	<p style="hp">After you put a health centre in, it takes three months for it to become active. They use goods.</p>
	<p style="hp">Health centres need to be connected to transport or within range of a market.</p>
	<p style="hp">To see the range of health cover, click on the health icon above the 'mini screen' (bottom right of centre on the display).</p>
