	<p style="htitle">Transport</p>
	<p style="hp">There are three types of transport in Lincity: tracks, roads and railways.</p>
	<p style="hp">There is a fourth form that consists of 'hopping across a field' to reach a market. This is a very short range form of trading and will not be referred to as transport again. However, it is very important, so you should read again <a href="market"> markets</a>.</p>
	<p style="hp">Tracks, roads and railways are used to carry food, labor, goods, coal, ore, steel and wastes between areas. Transport between markets, transport for buildings out of range of a market (this is generally a bad idea) and transport for building that explicitely need it:</p>
	<p style="hp">The transportation network can pick up, distribute and deliever any kind of commodity, except for high-voltage power which are flowing in power lines. All steps to, inside and from the transportation network require direct adjacency. The market behaves differently.</p>
	<p style="hp">To cross a river with transport, simply build the transport over the river and you will create a bridge. Bridges are much more expensive than normal transport.</p>
	<p style="hp">Roads and Rail causes yearly costs (for maintenance) and pollution (and more pollution if they carry lots of wastes).</p>
